A class representation for a Percival buffer command.

An instance is initialised with a percival.carrier.txrx.TxRx object and
also the target destination for commands (const.BufferTarget).  Commands
can then be constructed and sent depending on the target.  Commands can
be sent using the send_command method.

TODO: This assumes the buffer has already been filled with values.  This
class could instead of taking the number of words, take the actual words and
fill the buffer itself.
