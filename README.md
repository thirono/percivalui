## Introduction ##

The percivalui project allow users and detector engineers to control the Percival detector system from a python based user interface. The userinterface is simply a python class where properties and methods can be manipulated to control the detector.

The project is currently in early development stages. First goal is to produce a mock-up which will provide the user-interface without controlling any real hardware.

## Installation ##

This is a python module in development. While the development is ongoing the recommended setup is simply to run the python interpreter inside the top-level directory alongside the source packages.
